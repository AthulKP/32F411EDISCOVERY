# Basic interrupt code to get started
The '***inc***' folder has the abstracted rigister maps, '***src***' has **main.c** where the core logic and initialization is handled. Concepts handled :
* Cortex M4 NVIC
* Bare-metal or Resgister level codes
* External interrupt trigger using push button
* Led ouptut for visual understanding
