# 🔧 STM32F411 Discovery Projects (Bare-Metal / Register-Level)

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects built using the **STM32F411 Discovery board**, focused on **bare-metal development** by directly addressing hardware **registers** — no HAL, no libraries, just close-to-the-metal C code.

These projects explore the **ARM Cortex-M4** microcontroller architecture, built for performance, control, and a deep understanding of the **ARM M-class processor** internals.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To develop **hands-on embedded experience** with STM32F411 using **bare-metal C**.
- To gain a deep understanding of **ARM Cortex-M** architecture and **peripheral control** via direct register access.
- To create reusable examples for beginners and enthusiasts learning **low-level microcontroller programming**.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Bare-metal programming**: No operating system or abstraction layers.
- **Direct register access**: Using memory-mapped I/O and register-level manipulation.
- **ARM Cortex-M4F**: Focused on the M-class core features such as NVIC, SysTick, and CMSIS.
- **Embedded peripherals**: GPIO, USART, SPI, I2C, Timers, EXTI, ADC, etc.
