# System clock configurations 
We are configuring the system clock to different frequencies, from the default 16MHz to 30MHz,60MHz, and 100MHz (the maximum frequency). The system is set to run a for loop counting from 0 -> 1,600,000. For each clock configuration, the LEDs on board have been used for visualization, where the turn-on time is the time required for the processor to finish the for loop.
